\maketitle

\section{Dynamial systems}
Conley's decomposition theorem states that every flow of a dynamical system with compact phase portrait admits a decomposition into a chain-recurrent part and a gradient-like flow part.

\section{Cortical computation theory}
\citep{stevens1995}

\subsection{Types of cortex}\label{sec:types}
\paragraph{Unitary}
Only a single major computational type of cortex exists

\paragraph{Continuous diversity theory}
The character of some mathematical operation might vary continuously across even an apparently uniform coortical region like primary visual cortex



\subsection{Four requirements}
The theory 
\begin{itemize}
\item can accommodate the spectrum of possibilities: from unitary to continuous  diversity views (see \ref{sec:types})
\item should be probabilistic, because synaptic transmission is stochastic 
\item should be coarse grained and should treat cortical inputs and outputs as continuous variables
\item the output at any one point should be a functional of both inputs and outputs 
\end{itemize}





\section{Infinite horizon computation}	
\begin{definition}
Infinite horizon: agnostic to decoding time
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The output can only change if there is a change in the input. 
So cued output is allowed, but timing tasks are excluded.
\end{remark}

\section{Theorems on infinite horizon neural computation on a compact domain}


\subsection{Memory states}%the words in the language

\begin{theorem}
Asymptotic neural computation that is bounded has to rely on chain-recurrent sets.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}	
Infinite horizon neural computation that is bounded has to rely on the sets that have a chain-recurrent set as their $\omega$-limit set.
\end{theorem}	



\begin{proof}
Invariance to time decoding implies that trajectories (after the input is presented) that get decoded into a certain output need to retain that decoding

Convergence to the non-wandering set for a compact dynamical system \citep{conley1978}

Each of these trajectories will be in the set that has the same $\omega$-limit set.
\end{proof}


\subsubsection{Meaningful memory states (for the behavior) are charaterized by the output}
\begin{theorem}
For neural computation with a linear decoder, the sets of trajectories grouped by input (i.e. preimages of the decoder $f^{-1}(y)$ for $y\in Y$ the output space) must be linearly separable.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
If the assumption of a compact domain is relaxed, then the computation can involve an inertial manifold (as long as it is aligned with the nullspace of the decoder).
\end{remark}


\subsection{Syntax}%how words and morphemes combine to form larger units
%how information is integrated
%how input interacts with the represented information/the internal state

\subsubsection{Input driven dynamics}
Two cases to model it:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Input is modelled as a delta function, input reinitializes the system
\item Input is continuous 
\begin{itemize}
\item If input is constant, study it as a bifurcation parameter
\item Otherwise: non-autonomous dynamics (perhaps inertial manifold can be useful, they can provide a condition when dynamics is equivalent to the dynamics of an autonomous system)
\end{itemize}•
\end{enumerate}•
