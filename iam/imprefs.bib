  abstract  = "Mathematics is playing an ever more important role in the
               physical and biological sciences, provoking a blurring of
               boundaries between scienti?c disciplines and a resurgence of
               interest in the modern as well as the cl- sical techniques of
               applied mathematics. This renewal of interest, both in research
               and teaching, has led to the establishment of the series Texts in
               Applied Mathematics (TAM).

               excitement on the research frontier as newer techniques, such as
               numerical and symbolic computer systems, dynamical systems, and
               chaos, mix with and reinforce the traditional methods of applied
               mathematics. Thus, the purpose of this textbook series is to meet
               the current and future needs of these advances and to encourage
               the teaching of new courses. TAM will publish textbooks suitable
               for use in advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate courses,
               and will complement the Applied Ma- ematical Sciences (AMS)
               series, which will focus on advanced textbooks and research-level

               L. Sirovich College Park, Maryland S.S. Antman Preface This book
               is based on a two-semester course in ordinary di?erential eq-
               tions that I have taught to graduate students for two decades at
               the U- versity of Missouri. The scope of the narrative evolved
               over time from an embryonic collection of supplementary notes,
               through many classroom tested revisions, to a treatment of the
               subject that is suitable for a year (or more) of graduate study.",
