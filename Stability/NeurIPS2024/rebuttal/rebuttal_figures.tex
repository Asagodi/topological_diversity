    \textbf{(A)} The average accumulated angular error versus the uniform norm on the vector field shown for finite time (time of trial length on which networks were trained, \(T_1\)) indicated with filled markers and at asymptotic time (with hollow markers).
    \textbf{(B)}   The number of fixed points versus average accumulated angular error, with the average distance between neighbouring fixed points indicated in magenta.
