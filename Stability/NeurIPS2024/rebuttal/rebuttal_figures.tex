    \textbf{(A)} The average accumulated angular error versus the uniform norm on the vector field shown.
     Angular error at time of trial length on which networks were trained (\(T_1\), filled markers) and at asymptotic time (hollow markers).
      The number of fixed point is an integer number. The points are spread out slightly to aid visibility.
    \textbf{(B)}  The number of fixed points versus average accumulated angular error, with the average distance between neighbouring fixed points (magenta).

    \textbf{(A)} Initializations and fixed points of an example network.

    \textbf{(C)} The sum of the total mean angular error (sum of the two seperate angular errors over the two rings) is bounded by the uniform norm of the vector field.
    \textbf{(D)} Generalization for longer memory depends on the number of fixed points in the network.
