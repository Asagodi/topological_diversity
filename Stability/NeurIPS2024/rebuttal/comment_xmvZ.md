We thank the reviewer for the additional comments.




2. This is an insightful observation. We will incorporate this remark into the text to address the potential for extending the analysis from low-dimensional to higher-dimensional systems. Specifically, we'll note that even when a theory is initially developed for low-dimensional systems, it can often be extended to higher-dimensional cases through methods like center manifold theory, which can reveal that the higher-dimensional system has a structure akin to its low-dimensional counterpart.

We have now changed the statement in Sec.3.1 to be $l\neq 0$ for clarity.
