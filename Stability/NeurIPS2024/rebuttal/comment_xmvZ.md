We thank the reviewer for the additional comments.




2. This is an insightful observation, and we will incorporate this remark into the main text to address the potential for extending the analysis from low-dimensional to higher-dimensional systems. Specifically, we will emphasize that while the initial analysis may focus on low-dimensional systems, it can be generalized to higher-dimensional cases using methods like center manifold theory. This approach demonstrates that higher-dimensional systems can retain structural similarities to their low-dimensional counterparts.

Additionally, we will clarify in Supplementary Sections 1 and 2 that the provided examples are illustrative rather than exhaustive. Recognizing that the supplementary material previously lacked clear structure and signposting, we have revised the text to better convey the motivation behind the examples and to provide a clearer explanation of the analysis.

We have now changed the statement in Sec.3.1 to be $l\neq 0$ for clarity.
