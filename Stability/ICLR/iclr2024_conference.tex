\begin{abstract}
Attractor networks are essential theoretical components in recurrent networks for memory, learning, and computation.
However, the continuous attractors that are essential for continuous-valued memory suffer from structural instability---infinitesimal changes in the parameters can destroy the continuous attractor.
Moreover, the perturbed system's dynamics can exhibit divergent behavior with associated exploding gradients.
This poses a question about the utility of continuous attractors for systems that learn using gradient signals.
%This poses a problem in biological neural networks, as they are constantly subjected to perturbations caused by noise. Certain systems (e.g. systems with an unbounded attractor) can be perturbed in such a way, that not only do they bifurcate, but start exhibiting divergent behavior, which is especially problematic for systems that are learning (for example under gradient descent).
To address this issue, we use Fenichel's persistence theorem from dynamical systems theory to show that bounded attractors are stable in the sense that all perturbations maintain the stability.
This ensures that if there is a restorative learning signal, there will be no exploding gradients for any length of time for backpropagation.
In contrast, unbounded attractors may devolve into divergent systems under certain perturbations, leading to exploding gradients.
This insight also suggests that there can exist homeostatic mechanisms for certain implementations of continuous attractors that maintain the structure of the attractor sufficiently for the neural computation it is used in.
Finally, we verify in a simple continuous attractor that all perturbations preserve the invariant manifold and demonstrate the principle numerically in ring attractor systems.

%\end{center}

Recurrent neural/neuronal networks (RNNs) can process sequential observations and model temporal dependencies of arbitrary length.
At the same time, they are fundamentally limited by their finite-sized hidden states which form the only channel between the past and the future.
To store information over a long period of time, as many difficult tasks demand, RNNs can learn or be designed to have ``persistent memory''.
When the information of interest is continuous-valued, a natural solution is to use continuous attractors.
Continuous attractors are prevalent in theoretical neuroscience as tools to model neural representation and computation ranging from internal representations of head directions and eye positions to perceptual decision-making and working memory~\cite{Khona2022}.
Continuous attractors are also at the core of long short-term memory (LSTM)~\cite{Greff2017} units and the neural Turning machine (NTM)~\cite{Graves2014} to provide digital computer memory like properties not natural to recurrent networks. % with many applications such as meta-learning~\cite{Santoro2016}.
In fact, the critical weakness of continuous attractors is their inherent brittleness as they are rare in the parameter space, i.e., infinitesimal changes in parameters destroys the continuous attractor structures implemented in RNNs~\cite{seung1996,Renart2003}, even if biologically plausible asymmetric connections are used to construct them \citep{darshan2022}.
However, not all RNN implementations of continuous attractors behave similarly in their brittleness.

We found that in the space of RNNs, some have neighbourhoods with highly undesirable exploding gradients. We will describe some continuous attractors which have such neighbourhoods.
Consider an RNN (without input or output for now) expressed in continuous time as an ordinary differential equation:
\begin{align}\label{eq:TLN}
    \dot{\vx} = -\vx + \left[ \vW \vx + \vb \right]_{+}
\end{align}
where $\vx \in \reals^d$ is the hidden state of the network, $\vb > 0$ is the bias, and $[\cdot]_{+} = \max(0,\cdot)$ is the threshold nonlinearity per unit.
In discrete time, this corresponds to a ReLU RNN (see Sec.~\ref{sec:rnn:integration}).
The non-trivial activity of this network is limited to the (non-negative) first quadrant.

When $d=2$, we can build two kinds of continuous attractors.
First, through positive feedback, $\vW = [0, 1; 1, 0]$ and no bias $\vb = \mathbf{0}$, we can create a continuous attractor, i.e., $\dot{\vx} = 0$ on the $x_1 = x_2 \geq 0$ half-line, and surrounding attractive flow (Fig.~\ref{fig:ublabla}A left).
We refer to it as an \textbf{unbounded line attractor (UBLA)}.
For any point on the line attractor, linearization results in eigenvalues $0$ and $-2$, corresponding to the zero flow and attractive flow respectively.
When $\vW$ is perturbed, the null eigenvalue can easily become non-zero and the continuous line attractor disappears.
If it becomes negative, the system bifurcates to a stable fixed point at the origin (Fig.~\ref{fig:ublabla}A bottom).
However, if it becomes positive (Fig.~\ref{fig:ublabla}A top), \emph{the resulting flow diverges to infinity along the diagonal}.
Corresponding to the divergent flow, the backpropagating gradient over time exponentially grows in magnitude, thus rendering gradient descent impractical without truncation in time.

The second kind of continuous attractor is created through negative feedback.
By choosing $\vW = [0, -1; -1, 0]$ and $\vb = [1; 1]$, we get $\dot{\vx} = 0$ on the $x_1 = -x_2 + 1$ line segment in the first quadrant as the continuous attractor.
We refer to it as the \textbf{bounded line attractor (BLA)}.
Again, linearization on the attractor shows two eigenvalues, $0$ and $-2$, and perturbations again cause the null eigenvalue to be non-zero and the line attractor disappears.
However, surprisingly, the bifurcations are  qualitatively different.
It either bifurcates into a single stable fixed point (Fig.~\ref{fig:ublabla}B top) or two stable fixed points separated with a saddle node in between (Fig.~\ref{fig:ublabla}B bottom).
Neither of these two cases show a divergent flow, but rather consists of one or two basins of attraction.
It implies only vanishing gradients for this system and \textbf{exploding gradients will not be present for an arbitrarily long time}.

    Note that the parameters for the UBLA are near a diverging system associated with exploding gradient behavior.

\end{figure}

Avoiding exploding gradients is of paramount importance in the context of long-range temporal learning (Sec.~\ref{sec:imp:ML}).
Learning generally induces stochasticity in parameters, while spontaneous synaptic fluctuations are present in biological neuronal networks (Sec.~\ref{sec:imp:neuroscience}).
Given these observations, we predict that BLA would be a more stable motif for computation than UBLA in the presence of noise and continuous learning.
Since BLAs, but not UBLAs, avoid exploding gradients, if the desired computation requires a line attractor of finite range, BLA would be both easier to maintain and learn.
Is this only true for ReLU parameterized RNNs, or does it generalize?

In this paper, we lay out a new theory of general continuous-valued memory in the context of learning to answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can we avoid exploding gradients under parameter perturbation?
    \item Do we need to worry about the brittleness of the continuous attractor solutions in practice?
\end{enumerate}
Our theory provides answers to both questions under mild assumptions in an architecture agnostic manner.
Using Fenichel's invariant manifold theorem, we derive a sufficient condition for RNNs implementing continuous attractors to remain free of exploding gradients.
Moreover, even after a bifurcation, these RNNs still approximately behave like the original continuous attractor for a while.
Together these theoretical results practically nullify the concern of the fine tuning problem in theoretical neuroscience and suggest general principles for evaluating and designing new architectures and initialization strategies for RNNs in machine learning.

\section{Theory of gracefully degrading continuous attractors}\label{sec:theory}
In this section, we apply Fenichel's work on invariant manifolds to RNNs and translate the results for the machine learning and theoretical neuroscience audience.

\subsection{Invariant Continuous Attractor Manifold Theory}\label{sec:imt}
We start by formulating RNNs implementing a continuous attractor in continuous time: $\dot{\vx} = \vf(\vx)$.
Let $l$ be the intrinsic dimension of the manifold of equilibria that defines the continuous attractor.
We will reparameterize the dynamics around the manifold with coordinates $\vy \in \reals^l$ and the remaining ambient space with $\vz \in \reals^{d-l}$.
To describe an arbitrary bifurcation of interest, we introduce a sufficiently smooth function $g$ and a bifurcation parameter $\epsilon \geq 0$, such that the following system is equivalent to the original ODE:
\begin{align}\label{eq:fenichel:flow}
    \dot{\vy} &=           \epsilon  \vg(\vy, \vz, \epsilon) \qquad \text{(tangent)}\\
    \dot{\vz} &= \hphantom{\epsilon} \vh(\vy, \vz, \epsilon) \qquad \text{(normal)}
\end{align}
where $\epsilon = 0$ gives the condition for the continuous attractor $\dot{\vy} = \mathbf{0}$.
We denote the corresponding manifold of $l$ dimensions $M_0 = \{(\vy,\vz) \mid \vh(\vy,\vz,0) = 0\}$.

We need the flow normal to the manifold to be hyperbolic, that is \emph{normally hyperbolic}, meaning that the Jacobians $\nabla_\vz \vh$ evaluated on any point on the $\manifold_0$ has $d-l$ eigenvalues with non-zero real parts, and $\nabla_\vy \vg$ has $l$ eigenvalues with zero real parts.
More specifically, for continuous attractors, the real part of the eigenvalues of $\nabla_\vz \vh$ will be negative, representing sufficiently strong attractive flow toward the manifold.
Equivalently, for the ODE, $\dot{\vx} = \vf(\vx)$, the variational system is of constant rank, and has exactly $(d-l)$ eigenvalues with negative real parts and $l$ eigenvalues with zero real parts everywhere along the continuous attractor.

\begin{figure}[bthp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{FenichelThm.pdf}
  \caption{
    Fenichel's invariant manifold theorem applied to compact continuous attractor guarantees the flow on the slow manifold is locally invariant and continues to be attractive.
    The dashed line is a trajectory ``trapped'' in the slow manifold (locally invariant).
  }
  \label{fig:fenichel}
\end{figure}

When $\epsilon > 0$, the continuous attractor bifurcates away.
What can we say about the fate of the perturbed system?
The continuous dependence theorem~\cite{Chicone2006} says that the trajectories will change continuously as a function of $\epsilon$ without a guarantee on how quickly they change.
Moreover, the topological structure and the asymptotic behavior of trajectories change discontinuously due to the bifurcation.
Surprisingly there is a strong connection in the geometry due to Fenichel's theorem~\cite{fenichel1971}.
We informally present a special case due to~\cite{Jones1995}:
\begin{theorem}[Fenichel's Invariant Manifold Theorem]
Let $\manifold_0$ be a connected, compact, normally hyperbolic manifold of equilibria originating from a sufficiently smooth ODE.
For a sufficiently small perturbation $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a manifold $\manifold_\epsilon$ diffeomorphic to $\manifold_0$ and locally invariant under the flow of \eqref{eq:fenichel:flow}.
Moreover, $\manifold_\epsilon$ has corresponding smoothness.
\end{theorem}

The manifold $\manifold_\epsilon$ is called the \emph{slow manifold} which is no longer necessarily a continuum of equilibria.
However, the local invariance implies that trajectories remain within the manifold except potentially at the boundary.
Furthermore, the non-zero flow on the slow manifold is slow and given in the $\epsilon \to 0$ limit as $\RN{\vy}{\tau} = \vg(c^\epsilon(\vy), \vy, 0)$ where $\tau = \epsilon t$ is a rescaled time and $c^\epsilon(\cdot)$ parameterizes the $l$ dimensional slow manifold.
In addition, the stable manifold(s) of $\manifold_0$ are similarly approximately maintained~\cite{Jones1995}, allowing the continuous attractor to remain attractive.

These conditions are met (up to numerical precision) for the BLA example in Fig.~\ref{fig:ublabla}B.
As the theory predicts, BLA bifurcates into a 1-dimensional slow manifold (dark colored regions) that contains fixed points, and overall still attractive.
On the contrary, the UBLA does not satisfy the compactness condition, hence the theory does not predict its persistence.
Importantly, the ``slow'' flow on the perturbed system is not bounded.

% the compact case is that you have that the invariant manifolds are diffeomorphic to the original one. So neural states aren’t too far off from where they would have been before the perturbation.

In practice, the sufficient conditions for RNNs implementing continuous attractors to have this graceful breakdown is for the continuous attractor manifold to be of finite dimension throughout, connected, and bounded. 
However, in systems with an invariant manifold with dimension at least three, it is possible that a slow manifold with chaotic dynamics is created through a perturbation. This would have as consequence that the perturbed system acquires positive Lyapunov exponents (corresponding to the chaotic orbit), which then can still lead to exploding gradients.

\subsection{Implications on Machine Learning}\label{sec:imp:ML}
Extending the memory time constant of RNNs have long been an important area of research with much focus on random weights~\cite{Legenstein2007,Goldman2009,Toyoizumi2011,Kerg2019,Chen2018,Henaff2016,Rusch2021,arjovsky2016}.
Various initializations for the recurrent weights have been proposed to help learning: initialization with the identity matrix \citep{le2015}, with a random orthogonal matrix \citep{saxe2014,Henaff2016}, with a unitary matrix \citep{arjovsky2016} and with a block diagonal weight matrix that creates a quasi-periodic system with limit cycles \citep{Sokol2019a}.
However, despite the capacity to maintain representation of continuous quantities for arbitrary duration of time, continuous attractor mechanism has not been pursued in machine learning research because of its brittleness.
The stochasticity in gradients inherited from the training data, regularization strategy, and multi-task learning objectives act as a perturbation on the recurrent dynamics, and continuous attractors break down even if it could be learned.
Remedies emerged in machine learning to hard-code continuous-valued memory structures within the RNNs---e.g., the cell state in vanilla LSTM.
However, our theory shows that the geometric structure of the manifold and the flow around the manifold play a critical role in enabling gradient descent learning of continuous attractors using standard methods such as backpropagation through time (BPTT)~\cite{Toomarian1991}.

It is well known that asymptotic exploding gradients comes from positive Lyapunov exponents~\cite{Mikhaeil2022,Vogt2022,Engelken2023}.
It has also been pointed out that bifurcations can cause arbitrarily large gradients~\cite{doya1993} as well as discontinuity in the Lyapunov spectrum~\cite{Park2023a}.
These gradient propagation theories suggested that bifurcations should be avoided, including the continuous attractors.

As far as we know, there is no architecture agnostic theory describing the loss landscape around RNN solutions.
We remark that due to the singular nature of the center manifold that supports the continuous attractor, the usual analysis approach of linearization fails.
\emph{Our theory successfully connects the invariant manifold theory and the gradient signal propagation theory in RNNs to describe two types of loss landscape around continuous attractor solutions.}
In one case, when the theorem holds, the landscape is shallow in all directions due to (asymptotically) vanishing gradients induced by the attractor structure---we have the gracefully degrading continuous attractor.
On the other case, we can find examples where the theorem does not hold, and the continuous attractor solution is at the boundary of network configurations with exploding gradients, meaning the loss landscape is very steep in some directions.

While exploding gradients would prevent gradient descent to correct for deviations from the optima,
for gracefully degrading ones, one can apply restorative forces via gradient descent to be in the vicinity of the brittle continuous attractor solution (see Sec.~\ref{sec:exp:maintaining}).


\subsection{Implications on Neuroscience}\label{sec:imp:neuroscience}
Continuous attractors are biologically plausible, theoretically elegant, consistent with neural recordings, and avoids the asymptotic exploding and vanishing gradient problem~\cite{Park2023a}.
As a conceptual tool in computational and theoretical neuroscience, continuous attractors are widely used when working memory of continuous values is needed~\cite{Dayan2001,Burak2009,Khona2022}.
When used to accumulate stimulus, continuous attractors are also called neural integrators that are hypothesized to be the underlying computation for the maintenance of eye positions, heading direction, self-location, target location, sensory evidence, working memory, decision variables, to name a few~\cite{seung1996,Seung2000,Romo1999}.
Neural representation of continuous values have been observed as persistent activity in the prefrontal cortex of primates, ellipsoid body of the fly, and hypothalamus~\cite{Romo1999,Noorman2022,Nair2023}.
A typical computational implementation of a continuous attractor is a bump attractor network model which requires a mean-field limit~\cite{Skaggs1995,Camperi1998,Renart2003} and finite sized networks with threshold linear units \cite{Noorman2022,Spalla2021}, see also Sec.~\ref{sec:hd}.

However, the so-called ``fine-tuning problem'' describing the theoretical and practical brittleness of continuous attractors was recognized in~\citep{seung1998}.
Since biological neural systems have constantly fluctuating synaptic weights~\cite{shimizu2021}, this has been a big puzzle in the field.
There have been efforts and remedies to lessen the degradation for particular implementations, often focusing on keeping the short-term behavior close to the continuous attractor case~\cite{Lim2012,Lim2013,Boerlin2013,Koulakov2002,Renart2003}.

Our theory shows that not all continuous attractors are born equal, and there are gracefully degrading continuous attractors.
In finite time, trajectories are well-behaved, contrary to the asymptotic behavior captured by the Lyapunov exponents.
Animal behavior is finite time in nature and the longer the temporal distance the harder it is to learn in general.
The conditions are favorable in the recurrent neuronal networks: (1) mutual inhibition is widely present and evidence points to inhibition dominated dynamics,
(2) the neural state space is bounded due to physiological constraints-- by a non-negative firing rate below and a maximum firing rate above.

%Given an $d$-dimensional continuous attractor manifold embedded within a recurrent dynamics of $n$-dimensions, it supports persistent continuous memory of $d$-dimension.
%There are $d$ zero Lyapunov exponents corresponding to the perturbations tangent to the manifold, coinciding with the memory representation, and $(n-d)$ negative Lyapunov exponents that expresses the attractive nature.
%In theory, the topology of the manifold can be arbitrary, ideally matching the desired structure of the target variables.

\section{Experiments}



\subsection{Continuous-valued click integration task}\label{sec:task:continuous-clicks}
In order to demonstrate the stability of bounded attractors, we tested the theory in an integration task.
Although there are several standard benchmark tasks for temporal dependence learning with memory components,
due to the discrete nature of the relevant stimulus space, the solutions do not necessarily require a continuously-valued memory.
We designed a simple integration task where one of the optimal solutions is the continuous attractor.

We extend the Poisson clicks task which has been used for studying perceptual decision making~\cite{brunton2013}.
Neural integrators are considered to be crucial for the task for accumulating evidence over time and maintaining a continuous representation of the accumulated evidence.
For our experiments, we used discrete time representations over $T$ time bins and the real-valued\footnote{Approximated as single precision IEEE 754 floating point.} stimulus encoded as difference of two non-negative values:
\begin{align}
    I_{t,i} &= m_{t,i} \cdot u_{t,i} 
             \qquad & t=1,\dots, T, \ i=1,2 &&\text{(continuous clicks)}	\label{eq:input}
    \\
    O^\ast_{t} &= \sum_{s=0}^{t} \left(
        I_{s,1} - I_{s,2}
        \right)
            \qquad  & t=1,\dots, T &&  \text{(desired output)} 			\label{eq:output}
\end{align}
where $m_{t,i}$ are independent Bernoulli random variables with probability $0.2$ and $u_{t,i}$ are independent random variables with uniform distribution on the unit interval.
We used mean squared error (MSE) of the 1-dimensional output over time as the loss function over all time bins.
We used $T=500$ time bins per trial unless specified otherwise.
The gradients were computed in batch mode with $1024$ randomly generated trials.
The main challenges of this task are (1) addition and subtraction and (2) maintain the accumulated clicks for an extended period of time.

%The inputs for the clicks task are incoming clicks in two channels ($K=2$) and are given as follows.
%The non-zero inputs follow a Poisson distribution with given rates.
%At such time points, an input is sampled from $[0,1]$.
%The task is to output the difference between the two inputs in the two channels. 

%A noisy version of the task also includes noise added to a part of the input, without alternation to the target output, i.e., the noise added to the system should be ignored by the system.

\subsubsection{RNN solutions to the integration task}\label{sec:rnn:integration}
We use vanilla RNN implementations with the standard parameterization:
%An RNN \citep{elmanFindingStructureTime1990} consists of a $N \times N$ transition matrix $W$, an $L \times N$ decoder matrix $\wout$ (where $L$ is the output dimension), a $N \times K$ encoder matrix $\win$ (where $K$ is the input dimension), and a bias $b$ for the hidden state and $\bout$ for the output.
% If either the output or input is categorical, $M$ (respectively $N$) is the number of classes, and we use a one-hot representation. 
%As the RNN ingests a sequence, at each timestep it updates to a hidden state $h$, and using the hidden state and the decoder matrix, produces outputs $y$:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
	\vx_t &= \sigma(\win \vI_t + \vW \vx_{t-1} + \vb) \label{eq:RNN:discrete}\\
	O_t &= \wout \vx_t + \bout
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\vx_t \in \reals^d$ is the hidden state, $\vI_t \in \reals^K$ is the input,
$\sigma: \reals \to \reals$ an activation function which acts on each of the hidden dimension, and
$\vW, \vb, \win, \wout, \bout$ are parameters.
Assuming an Euler integration with unit time step, the discrete-time RNN of \eqref{eq:RNN:discrete} corresponds to the ODE:
\begin{align}
    \dot{\vx} &= -\vx + \sigma(\win \vI + \vW \vx + \vb) \label{eq:RNN:continuous}
\end{align}

For tractable analysis, we consider $2$ dimensional systems with ReLU activation. %We include another continuous attractor, the identity RNN, which is also a popular initialization for RNN training \citep{le2015}.
We study the three different ReLU RNN implementations of an integrator in a 2 dimensional system, the Identity RNN (iRNN), UBLA and BLA.
On the original clicks task the UBLA and BLA networks count the click differences directly, while iRNN counts the clicks separately and then subtracts these representations through the output mapping.
The behaviors of UBLA and BLA in the absence of stimulus are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ublabla}, while the behavior of the iRNN is trivial since there is no flow. These networks are defined as follows.



\paragraph{Identity RNN}
\label{sec:ubpa,sec:iRNN}
%This is an RNN with the identity matrix as its recurrent weights  with two hidden units. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:irnn}
\win = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1  &  0 \\
0 &  1
\end{pmatrix}, \
\vW = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1  &  0 \\
0  &  1
\end{pmatrix}, \
\wout = 
\begin{pmatrix}
-1  \\  1 
\end{pmatrix}, \
\vb = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0  \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}, \
\bout = 0.
\end{equation}

%The system has the whole state space as its invariant manifold.

\paragraph{Unbounded line attractor}
We formulate this implementation of a bounded integrator with a parameter that determines step size along line attractor $\alpha$. Together with the parametere for the output bias $\beta$ the parameters determine the capacity of the network. While the line attractor is unbounded from above, it only extends to the center from below.  The step size along line attractor $\alpha$ determines the maximum number of clicks as the difference between the two channels; the capacity is $\beta/\alpha$ number of clicks.
\label{sec:ubla}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ubla}
\win = \alpha
\begin{pmatrix}
-1  &  1 \\
-1  &  1
\end{pmatrix}, \
\vW = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0  &  1 \\
1  &  0
\end{pmatrix}, \
\wout = \frac{1}{2\alpha}
\begin{pmatrix}
1  \\  1 
\end{pmatrix}, \
\vb = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0  \\  0
\end{pmatrix}, \
\bout = -\frac{\beta}{\alpha}.
\end{equation}



\paragraph{Bounded line attractor}\label{sec:bla}
Similarly as for UBLA, the BLA has a parameter that determines step size along line attractor $\alpha$. Analogously as for UBLA, these parameters determine the capacity of the network.
The inputs push the input along the line attractor in two opposite directions, see below. UBLA and BLA need to be initialized at $\beta(1,1)$ and $\tfrac{\beta}{2}(1,1)$, respectively, for correct decoding, i.e., output projection.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:bla}
\win = \alpha
\begin{pmatrix}
-1  &  1 \\
1  &  -1
\end{pmatrix}, \
\vW = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0  &  -1 \\
-1  &  0
\end{pmatrix}, \
\wout = \frac{1}{2\alpha}
\begin{pmatrix}
1  \\  -1 
\end{pmatrix}, \
\vb = \beta
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\  1 
\end{pmatrix}, \
\bout = 0.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Asymmetric loss landscape due to exploding gradients}
To illustrate the effect of bifurcations from continuous attractor solution, we take a 1-dimensional slice of the loss surface.
Specifically, we take the self-recurrent connection and systematically vary:
\begin{align}
    \vW_{1,1} \leftarrow \vW_{1,1} + \Delta.
\end{align}
The result is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:maintenance}A.
For UBLA and iRNN, positive perturbations shows exponentially increasing loss due to the bifurcation to an exploding gradient dynamical system.
In all other cases, including all perturbations of BLA, leads to vanishing gradient, hence the loss is bounded.

\subsubsection{Bifurcation probability and random perturbations}
We consider all parametrized perturbations of the form $ \vW \leftarrow \vW + \vV$ for a random matrix $\vV\in \mathbb{R}^{2\times 2}$.
The BLA can bifurcate in the following systems, characterized by their invariant sets: a system with single stable fixed point, a system with three fixed points (one unstable and two stable) and  a system with two fixed points (one stable and the other a half-stable node) and a system with a (rotated) line attractor. 
Only the first two bifurcations (Fig. ~\ref{fig:ublabla}) can happen with nonzero chance for the type of random perturbations we consider.
The perturbations that leave the line attractor intact or to a system with two fixed points have measure zero in parameter space.
The types of perturbation with measure zero are codimension 2 bifurcations.
The perturbation that results in one fixed point happen with probability $\frac{3}{4}$, while perturbations lead to a system with three fixed points with probability $\frac{1}{4}$, see Supp. \ref{sec:supp:bla}.




\subsubsection{Maintaining a neural integrator}\label{sec:exp:maintaining}
To investigate the differential effect of gradient descent on the three neural integrator models, we performed three learning experiments using the continuous-valued click integration task.
The input and output are defined as in Eqs. \ref{eq:input} and \ref{eq:output} with $I_{t,i}=0$ for $t=11,\dots,T$.
%T=100,500,1000
We investigate the effects of three types of noise on the learning or readjustment of the parameters during gradient descent starting from the perfect solutions to the task.
%MSE at last time step

In the first experiment, Gaussian random noise is injected to all parameters inducing a constant diffusion of the parameters, which emulates the biological synaptic variability.
This type of noise is directly applied to the weights as $ \vW \leftarrow \vW + \vV$ with $\vV_{i,j}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma)$.
%Fig.~\ref{fig:maintenance}B shows that for BLA, gradient descent (with constant learning rate, chosen from a grid search) was able to counter the diffusion.
%Note that the magnitude of perturbation were identical for all networks, but iRNN is more robust in terms of MSE.
%The distribution of MSE for the task can be used as proxy for the misadjustment from the optimal solution.
%BLA with learning has superior misadjustment to UBLA and BLA without learning.

%We inject this noise into the system either after each learning epoch 
%(Fig. \ref{fig:maintenance}B)
% or in pulses only at epochs
%  1,11 and 21 (Fig. \ref{fig:maintenance}C).

The invariant manifold of the BLA is persistent throughout learning in many cases, see Fig. \ref{sec:supp:learning} and \ref{fig:vfs1}.

To dissociate the effect of misadjustment from gradient descent and external perturbation, we interleaved a larger perturbation with 10 gradient steps.
Fig.~\ref{fig:maintenance}C shows consistent learning in the average MSE for BLA and iRNN, but not in UBLA.
The individual runs indicate larger variability induced by learning over time, which we quantify in Fig.~\ref{fig:maintenance}D.
iRNN and UBLA both have larger learning noise than BLA, consistent with the absence of exploding gradient configuration around the optimum.



We investigated the effect of learning when perturbations are induced by the backpropagated gradient which is structured by the recurrent dynamics in the following two ways.
The second type of noise is injected into the input $x_{i,t}+\epsilon_{i,t}$ with $\epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma)$.
To inject noisy gradients naturally, we added noise to the input to the first 10 time steps during the trial that were not integrated in the target output $O_t^*$ (Eq. \ref{eq:output}).
The third type of noise is injected into the hidden state $h_{i,t}+\epsilon_{i,t}$ with $\epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma)$ for $t=1,\dots, T$ and $i=1,2$. 
%\ref{fig:}
%Then we looked for networks that diverged due to exploding gradients which we identify as having a loss of 1 or higher. 
%Fig.~\ref{fig:maintenance}E shows that both UBLA and iRNN diverge more quickly under gradient descent than the BLA.
%$This is because the noise sometimes pushes the UBLA to the regime with divergent dynamics which leads to exploding gradients, which then causes the weights to make bigger jumps.

The noise level $\sigma$ was chosen individually for the three networks as follows. 
We calculated the loss on a batch of inputs for various noise levels.
We then chose the corresponding noise level per integrator that corresponded to the average loss (see also in Sec. \ref{sec:supp:matching}). For the noise in the weights the average was taken over 200 weight perturbations.
This way of matching noise level to induce the same average loss should be a universal approach to be able to compare the performance of different networks to each other.

%The parameters that were used for the effects of input- and parameter-type noise are summarized in Table \ref{tab:params}.
%The bias parameters of the UBLA and BLA networks were set to $\beta=100$, while $\alpha=1$. 
%The hidden state at the beginning of a trial is a learnable parameter. 
%The optimal learning rates for the input-type noise experiments were chosed from a set of three values ($\{10^{-8},10^{-9},10^{-10}\}$) based on best performance of the task of 20 runs.
%
%A sequence of inputs is generated of maximum length $T_I$ generated as described above. 
%For the experiments with D-type noise, we generate noise in the input for a sequence length of 10 time steps and distribution width sampled from the uniform distribution $(-\sigma,\sigma)$ with $\sigma=10^{-6}$.
%For the experiments with noise in the weights, we perturb the weights with a matrix with entries sampled from $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma)$.
%We inject this noise into the system either after each learning epoch (Fig. \ref{fig:maintenance}B) or in pulses only at epochs 1,11 and 21 (Fig. \ref{fig:maintenance}C).
%The first experiment should demonstrate the effects of the restorative force of learning.

%gradientdistribution 
Gradient distributions for all noise levels and learning rates. For some noise levels a bimodal distribution can be seen for the LAs, but exploding gradients seem to be absent for iRNN for low learning rates.
The fact that the iRNN has a smaller range of gradients explains exploding gradients at a higher learning rate for iRNN and the need for a higher learning rate for optimal maintenance of the solution.

%example
%standard: mses over epochs
Fig.~\ref{fig:maintenance}A and F shows that for all networks, gradient descent (with constant learning rate, chosen from a grid search) was able to counter the diffusion.
%Note that the magnitude of perturbation were identical for all networks, but iRNN is more robust in terms of MSE.
The distribution of MSE for the task can be used as proxy for the misadjustment from the optimal solution. We further show that iRNN converges to a different solution as it settles in a regime in parameter space that has a higher norm difference with the initial parameters of the neural integrator.
%BLA with learning has superior misadjustment to UBLA and BLA without learning.

%scatter
iRNN often finds a different optimum (it settles at a part of the state space that is at a non-zero distance from the initial recurrent matrix and bias (Fig. \ref{fig:maintenance} and Fig \ref{fig:vfs1}).
UBLA can stays close to the initial solution for small enough learning rate.
%BLA is slowly running away? maybe learning rate too large?

\subsection{Perturbation of a continuous attractor: Finite-sized head direction network model}\label{sec:hd}
%We will now investigate the effects that perturbations might have on the gradients in some continuous attractor network models used in computational neuroscience.

%\subsubsection{Finite-sized head direction network model}

Continuous attractor models of the head direction representation suggest that the representation emerges from the interactions of recurrent connections among neurons that form a circular or ring-like structure \citep{zhang1996, Noorman2022, ajabi2023}. 
Since continuous attractors are susceptible to noise and perturbations the precise representation of the head direction can in principle be disrupted easily.
We will demonstrate the implications of the Persistence theorem in the case of the implementation of a continuous ring attractor presented in \citep{Noorman2022}.
As this continuous ring attractor is bounded its invariant manifold persists and, hence, no divergent orbits are created under small perturbations to this system. 
Furthermore, because the ring attractor is boundaryless it is both forward and backward invariant, i.e. hence it is invariant and trajectories never leave the persistent invariant manifold\citep{wiggins1994}.
This model is composed of $N$ heading-tuned neurons  with preferred headings $\theta_j \in \{\frac{2\pi i}{N}\}_{i=1\dots N}$ radians.
For sufficiently strong local excitation (given by the parameter $J_E$) and broad inhibition ($J_I$), this network will generate a stable bump of activity, one corresponding to each head direction. This continuum of fixed points forms a one dimensional manifold homeomorphic to the circle. 

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
     \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{both_rings}
       \caption{Characterization of bifurcations of two ring attractors. 
       (A)       Perturbations to the ring attractor introduced in \cite{Noorman2022}. The ring attractor can be perturbed in any system with an even number of fixed points (stable and saddle points are paired) up to $2N$. 
       (B) Perturbations to a simple implementation of a ring attractor all leave the invariant manifold intact.
       }
         \label{fig:both_rings}
\end{figure}
We will first of all look at a simple (non-biological) system that has a ring attractor to demonstrate the consequences of the Persistence Theorem.
The system we will analyse is defined by the following ODE: $\dot r = r(1-r), \ \dot \theta = 0.$
This system has as fixed points the ring with radius one centered around zero, i.e., $(0,0)\cup\{(1,\theta)\ |\ \theta\in[0,2\pi)\}$. All perturbations maintain the invariant manifold (Fig. \ref{fig:both_rings}B).

We evaluate the  the effect of parameteric perturbations of the form $ \vW \leftarrow \vW + \vV$ with $\vV_{i,j}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\frac{1}{100})$ on a network of size $N = 6$ with $J_E^*= 4$ and $J_I=-2.4$ through. 
We found that the ring can be perturbed into systems with between 2 and 12 fixed points (Fig. \ref{fig:both_rings}A).
The probability of the different perturbations were calculated numerically.
%The space of possible perturbations in Sec. ~\ref{sec:imt} is very large. To be able to form an image of what happens in the theorem we will work out the effect of some examples of perturbations.





\section{Discussion}
We have derived a general theory that describes the loss landscape of RNNs around continuous attractor solutions.
This theory implies backpropagating gradient does not explode for systems near compact continuous attractors because of divergent dynamics.
This insight also suggests that there can exist homeostatic mechanisms for certain implementations of continuous attractors that maintain the structure of the attractor sufficiently for the neural computation it is used in, which we demonstrate in simple networks.

%activation functions
It is well-known that activation functions play a critical role in propagating these gradients effectively through the network  \citep{jagtap2023, ramachandran2017, hayou2019}.
The activation function can have many forms.
The ones that are $C^r$ for $r\geq 1$ are the ones to which the Persistence Theorem applies. 
The Persistence Theorem further specifies how the smoothness of the activation can have implications on the smoothness of the persistence invariant manifold.
For situations where smoothness of the persistent invariant manifold is of importance, smoother activation functions might be preferable, such as the Exponential Linear Unit (ELU)\citep{clevert2015} or the Continuously Differentiable Exponential Linear Units (CELU) \citep{barron2017}.

%RNNs are capable of learning complex patterns and relationships in the data, which makes them in particular useful as models for neural computations. This is achieved through the use of non-linear activation functions and the training of the network using backpropagation through time (BPTT).
%BPTT allows the network to adjust the weights of the connections between neurons based on the error signal that is propagated backwards through time. 
%%This makes them suitable models for 
%
%However, training RNNs using back-propagation through time to compute error-derivatives can be difficult.  Early attempts suffered from vanishing and exploding gradients \citep{kolen2001} and this meant that they had great difficulty learning long-term dependencies. 
%Many different methods have been proposed for overcoming this difficulty.


\section{Persistence in non-differentiable vector fields}
The applicability of the Persistence Theorem to non-differentiable vector fields would depend on the specific characteristics of the system and the nature of the non-differentiability.
%

\section{Bifurcation analysis of the line attractors}

\subsection{Discrepancies between discrete and continuous RNNs}
\label{sec:discrepancies}
In the discrete time version of vanilla RNN \eqref{eq:RNN:discrete}, there can exist 2-period orbits, which are absent in the \eqref{eq:RNN:continuous} version.

\subsection{Unbounded line attractor}
\label{sec:ubla}

The parameters:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bla}
\win = \alpha
\begin{pmatrix}
-1  &  1 \\
1  &  -1
\end{pmatrix}, \
W = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0  &  1 \\
1  &  0
\end{pmatrix}, \
\wout = \frac{1}{2\alpha}
\begin{pmatrix}
1  &  1 
\end{pmatrix}, \
\bout = -\frac{\beta}{\alpha}.
\end{equation}

The bias to the recurrent units is zero.


\paragraph{Stabilty of the fixed point with full support}
We investigate how perturbations to the bounded line affect the Lyapunov spectrum.
We calculate the eigenspectrum of the Jacobian:
\begin{align*}
\det [W' -(1+\lambda)\mathbb{I}] &= (\epsilon_{11}-1-\lambda)(\epsilon_{22}-1-\lambda)-(\epsilon_{12}+1)(\epsilon_{21}+1)\\
&=\lambda^2 - (2+\epsilon_{11}+\epsilon_{22})\lambda -\epsilon_{11}-\epsilon_{22}+\epsilon_{11}\epsilon_{22} -\epsilon_{12} - \epsilon_{21} - \epsilon_{12}\epsilon_{21}
\end{align*}

Let 
$u=- (2+\epsilon_{11}+\epsilon_{22})$
and 
$v=-\epsilon_{11}-\epsilon_{22}+\epsilon_{11}\epsilon_{22} -\epsilon_{12} - \epsilon_{21} - \epsilon_{12}\epsilon_{21}$

There are only two types of invariant set for the perturbations of the line attractor. Both have as invariant set a fixed point at the origin. What distinguishes them is that one type of perturbations leads to this fixed point being stable while the other one makes it unstable.



\subsection{Bounded line attractor}\label{sec:supp:bla}
%Another implementation of a perfect integrator: one which is bounded.

\paragraph{Input}
Parameter that determines step size along line attractor $\alpha$.
The size determines the maximum number of clicks as the difference between the two channels. 

This pushes the input along the line ``attractor" in two opposite directions, %what is the correct word for this type of invariant set?
see below.

The parameters:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bla}
\win = \alpha
\begin{pmatrix}
-1  &  1 \\
1  &  -1
\end{pmatrix}, \
W = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0  &  -1 \\
-1  &  0
\end{pmatrix}, \
\wout = \frac{1}{2\alpha}
\begin{pmatrix}
1  &  -1 
\end{pmatrix}, \
b = \beta
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\  1 
\end{pmatrix}, \
\bout = 0.
\end{equation}

Needs to be initialized at $\tfrac{\beta}{2}(1,1)$ for correct decoding, i.e., output projection



\paragraph{Stabilty of the fixed points}
We perform the stability analysis for the part of the state space where $Wx>0$.
There, the Jacobian is
\begin{equation}
J = -
\begin{pmatrix}
1  &  1 \\
1  &  1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

We apply the perturbation
\begin{equation}
W' = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0  &  -1 \\
-1  &  0
\end{pmatrix}
+ \epsilon
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\epsilon_{11}  &  \epsilon_{12} \\
\epsilon_{21}  &  \epsilon_{22}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The eigenvalues are computed as
\begin{align*}
\det [W' -(1+\lambda)\mathbb{I}] &= (\epsilon_{11}-1-\lambda)(\epsilon_{22}-1-\lambda)-(\epsilon_{12}-1)(\epsilon_{21}-1)\\
&=\lambda^2 + (2-\epsilon_{11}-\epsilon_{22})\lambda -\epsilon_{11}-\epsilon_{22}+\epsilon_{11}\epsilon_{22} +\epsilon_{12} + \epsilon_{21} - \epsilon_{12}\epsilon_{21}
\end{align*}

Let 
$u=2-\epsilon_{11}-\epsilon_{22}$
and 
$v=-\epsilon_{11}-\epsilon_{22}+\epsilon_{11}\epsilon_{22} + \epsilon_{12} + \epsilon_{21} - \epsilon_{12}\epsilon_{21}$

\begin{equation}
\lambda = \frac{-u \pm \sqrt{u^2-4v}}{2}
\end{equation}



Case 1: $\operatorname{Re}(\sqrt{u^2-4v})<-u$, then 
$\lambda_{1,2}<0$


Case 2:  $\operatorname{Re}(\sqrt{u^2-4v})>-u$, then 
$\lambda_{1}<0$ and $\lambda_{2}>0$


Case 3: $v=0$, then 
$\lambda=\tfrac{1}{2}(-u\pm u)$, i.e.,
$\lambda_1=0$ and  $\lambda_2=-u$

\begin{align}
\epsilon_{11} &= -\epsilon_{22}+\epsilon_{11}\epsilon_{22} + \epsilon_{12} + \epsilon_{21} - \epsilon_{12}\epsilon_{21}
\end{align}



We give some examples of the different types of perturbations to the bounded line attractor.
The first type is when the invariant set is composed of a single fixed point, for example for the perturbation:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \frac{1}{10}
\begin{pmatrix}
-2  &  1 \\
 1   &  -2
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
%See Figure \ref{fig:bounded_lineattractor_allpert}, left upper.



The second type is when the invariant set is composed of three fixed points:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \frac{1}{10}
\begin{pmatrix}
1  &  -2 \\
 -2  &  1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The third type is when the invariant set is composed of two fixed points, both with partial support.
\begin{equation}
b' =  \frac{1}{10}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The fourth and final type is when the line attractor is maintained but rotated:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon =  \frac{1}{20}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 10\\
10 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{theorem}
All perturbations of the bounded line attractor are of the types as listed above.
\end{theorem}



\begin{proof}
We enumerate all possibilities for the dynamics of a ReLU activation network with two units.
First of all, note that there can be no limit cycle or chaotic orbits.

Now, we look at the different possible systems with fixed points.
There can be at most three fixed points \citep[Corollary 5.3]{morrisonDiversityEmergentDynamics2022}.
There has to be at least one fixed point, because the bias is non-zero.

%1 fixed point
General form (example):
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \frac{1}{10}
\begin{pmatrix}
-2  &  1 \\
 1   &  -2
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

One fixed point with full support:

In this case we can assume $W$ to be full rank.

\begin{align*}
\dot x = 
\relu\left[
\begin{pmatrix}
\epsilon_{11}  &  \epsilon_{12} \\
\epsilon_{21}  &  \epsilon_{22}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1\\x_2
\end{pmatrix}
+
\begin{pmatrix}
1\\1
\end{pmatrix}
\right]
-
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1\\x_2
\end{pmatrix}
&=0
\end{align*}


Note that $x>0$ iff $z_1\coloneqq \epsilon_{11}x_1 + (\epsilon_{12}-1)x_2-1>0$. Similarly for $x_2>0$.

So for a fixed point with full support, we have 
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1\\x_2
\end{pmatrix}
=A^{-1}
\begin{pmatrix}
-1\\-1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
with 
\[A\coloneqq\begin{pmatrix}
\epsilon_{11}-1  &  \epsilon_{12}-1 \\
\epsilon_{21}-1  &  \epsilon_{22}-1
\end{pmatrix}.\]


Note that it is not possible that $x_1=0=x_2$.

Now define
\[
B\coloneqq A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det A}
\begin{pmatrix}
\epsilon_{22}-1  &  1-\epsilon_{12} \\
1-\epsilon_{21}  &  \epsilon_{11}-1
\end{pmatrix}
\]
with \[\det A = \epsilon_{11}\epsilon_{22}-\epsilon_{11}-\epsilon_{22}-\epsilon_{12}\epsilon_{21}+\epsilon_{12}+\epsilon_{21}.\]

Hence, we have that $x_1,x_2>0$ if $B_{11}+B_{12}>0$, $B_{21}+B_{22}>0$ and $\det A >0$ 
and $B_{11}+B_{12}<0$, $B_{21}+B_{22}<0$ and $\det A <0$.

This can be satisfied in two ways, 
If $\det A >0$, this is satisfied if $\epsilon_{22}>\epsilon_{12}$ and $\epsilon_{11}>\epsilon_{21}$,
while if $\det A >0$, this is satisfied if $\epsilon_{22}<\epsilon_{12}$ and $\epsilon_{11}<\epsilon_{21}$.
This gives condition 1. %necessary condition (#1)



Finally, we investigate the condition that specify that there are fixed points with partial support.
%condition for no fixed points for which $x_i=0$ for i=1 or i=2 (necessary condiiton #2)
If $x_1=0$ then $(\epsilon_{22}-1)x_2+1=0$ and $z_1<0$. 
From the equality, we get that $x_{2}=\frac{1}{1-\epsilon_{22}}$.
From the inequality, we get  $(\epsilon_{12}-1)x_2+1\geq 0$, i.e. $\frac{1}{1-\epsilon_{12}}\geq x_2$.
Hence, 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{1-\epsilon_{12}}\geq\frac{1}{1-\epsilon_{22}}
\end{equation*}
and thus
\begin{equation}\label{eq:condition2.1}
\epsilon_{22} \leq \epsilon_{12}.
\end{equation}

Similiarly to have a fixed point $x^*$ such that $x_2^*=0$, we must have that 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:condition2.2}
\epsilon_{11} \leq \epsilon_{21}.
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:condition2.1} and \ref{eq:condition2.2} together form condition 2.


Then, we get the following conditions for the different types of bifurcations:
\begin{enumerate}
%2 fixed points
\item  If condition 1 is violated, but condition 2 is satisfied with exactly oner strict inequality, there are two fixed points on the boundary of the admissible quadrant.
%what about the subconditions:
\item If condition 1 is violated, and only one of the subconditions of condition 2 is satisfied, there is a single fixed point on one of the axes.
\item If condition 2 is violated, there is a single fixed point with full support.
%what about the subconditions?
%3 fixed points
\item If both conditions are satisfied, there are three fixed points.
%what about the subconditions?
\end{enumerate}


We now look at the possibility of the line attractor being preserved. 
This is the case if $v=0$.
It is not possible to have a line attractor with a fixed point off of it for as there cannot be disjoint fixed points that are linearly dependent \citep[Lemma 5.2]{morrison2016a}.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Probability of bifurcation types}
We check what proportion of the bifurcation parameter space is constituted with bifurcations of the type that result in three fixed points.

The conditions are 
\begin{align*}
0 &< \epsilon_{11}\epsilon_{22}-\epsilon_{11}-\epsilon_{22}-\epsilon_{12}\epsilon_{21}-\epsilon_{12}-\epsilon_{21},\\
\epsilon_{22} &\leq \epsilon_{12},\\
\epsilon_{11} &\leq \epsilon_{21}.
\end{align*}


We show that if 
\begin{align*}
\epsilon_{22} &\leq \epsilon_{12},\\
\epsilon_{11} &\leq \epsilon_{21}.
\end{align*}
then always 
\begin{align*}
0 &< \epsilon_{11}\epsilon_{22}-\epsilon_{11}-\epsilon_{22}-\epsilon_{12}\epsilon_{21}-\epsilon_{12}-\epsilon_{21}.
\end{align*}


This implies that this bifurcation happens with $\frac{1}{4}$ probability in a $\epsilon$-ball around the BLA neural integrator with $\epsilon<1$.

%%discrete attractors as a trivial application?
%%Discrete attractors can be seen as an approximation to continuous attractor models in the context of head direction representation \citep{zhang1996}. The discrete nature of the representation makes it more robust to small fluctuations or disturbances in neural activity.
%%However, these system have fading memory: the system eventually forgets the past, since any difference between any two neural activations eventually tends zero as they both evolve to a global resting state.
%
%We will first of all look at a simple (non-biological) system that has a ring attractor to demonstrate the consequences of the Persistence Theorem.
%The system we will analyse is defined by the following ODE: $\dot r = r(1-r), \ \dot \theta = 0.$
%This system has as fixed points the ring with radius one centered around zero, i.e., $(0,0)\cup\{(1,\theta)\ |\ \theta\in[0,2\pi)\}$.

%All perturbations maintain the invariant manifold.

\subsection{Fast-slow form}

We transform the state space so that the line attractor aligns with the $y$-axis.
So, we apply the affine transformation $R_\theta(x-\frac{1}{2})$ with the rotation matrix $R_\theta = \begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta &-\sin\theta\\\sin\theta&\cos\theta\end{bmatrix}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}1 &1\\-1&1\end{bmatrix}$ where we have set $\theta=-\frac{\pi}{4}$.
So we perform the transformation $x\rightarrow x'= R_\theta(x-\frac{1}{2})$ and so we have $x=R^{-1}_\theta x'+\frac{1}{2}$ with $R^{-1}_\theta = R_{-\theta}$.
Then we get that 
\begin{align}
R_{\theta}^{-1}\dot x' = \operatorname{ReLU}\left(W(R^{-1}_\theta x'+\frac{1}{2})+1\right)-R^{-1}_\theta x'-\frac{1}{2}.
\end{align}
For a perturbed connection matrix $W=\begin{bmatrix}\epsilon &-1\\-1&0\end{bmatrix}$ we get 
\begin{align}
R_{\theta}^{-1}\dot x' &= \operatorname{ReLU}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}\epsilon &-1\\-1&0\end{bmatrix}\left(\begin{bmatrix}1 &-1\\1&1\end{bmatrix} x'+\frac{1}{2}\right)+1\right)-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}1 &-1\\1&1\end{bmatrix} x'-\frac{1}{2}\\
\dot x' &=\begin{bmatrix}-1 &1\\1&1\end{bmatrix}\left(\frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}\epsilon-1 &-\epsilon-1\\-1&1\end{bmatrix}x' + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}\epsilon-1 \\-1\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}1 \\1\end{bmatrix}-\frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}1 \\1\end{bmatrix}\right)-x'\\
\dot x' &=\left(\begin{bmatrix}-2 &0\\0&0\end{bmatrix}+\frac{\epsilon}{2}\begin{bmatrix}1 &-1\\-1&1\end{bmatrix}\right)x' + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}\epsilon \\-\epsilon\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}






\section{Ring perturbations}

%Definition of a bump perturbation
We define a local perturbation (i.e., a change to the ODE with compact support) through the bump function $\Psi(x) = \exp\left(\frac{1}{\|x\|^2-1}\right)$ for $\|x\|<1$ and zero outisde, by multiplying it with a uniform, unidirectional vector field. All such perturbations leave at least a part of the continuous attractor intact and preserve the invariant manifold, i.e. the parts where the fixed points disappear a slow flow appears.
%Definition of a global perturbation
The parametrized perturbations are characterized as the addition of random matrix to the connection matrix. 



\section{Heading direction network}

\begin{equation}
\tau \dot h_j = -h_j + \frac{1}{N} \sum_k (W^{sym}_{jk} + v_{in} W^{asym}_{jk})\phi(h_k)+c_{ff},     j=1,\dots,N,
\end{equation}

In the absence of an input ($v_{in}=0$) fixed points of the system can be found analytically by considering all submatrices $W^{sym}_\sigma$ for all subsets $\{\sigma\subset [n]\}$ with$[n]=\{1,\dots, N\}$.
A fixed point $x^*$ needs to satisfy
\begin{equation}
x^*= -(W^{sym}_\sigma)^{-1}c_{ff}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
x^*_i<0 \text{   for  	 } i\in\sigma.
\end{equation}
